/*
Immediately Invoked Function Expression (IIFE)

#IIFEs have limitations:-
------------------------------------
 such as not being able to be reused, or not being able to access variables and functions outside of their own scope. ...
The syntax for creating an IIFE can be somewhat complex, especially for developers who are new to JavaScript, making it more difficult to read and understand.

----------------------------------

-IIFE is used to create private and  public variables and methods.
-It is used to execute the async and await function.
-It is used to work with require function.
